\section*{Introduction}
The purpose of this assessment is to evaluate your working practices.  We want to see that you are working like a sysadmin should.  The assessment has three parts:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item  \textbf{Self assessment:}  You will evaluate your own performance and provide evidence to support your claims;
  \item  \textbf{Peer assessment:}  You will evaluate your team members using the same measures that you used for your self assessment;
  \item  \textbf{Lecturer assessment:}  The lecturer will evaluate and comment on your performance.
\end{enumerate}

Note that on the self and peer assessments, your marks are based on how complete, accurate, and well supported your assessments are.

\section*{Marking schedule}
\textbf{Self assessment (10 marks):}

\begin{itemize}
  \item 10 - Insightful and accurate assessment of performance supported by ample clear evidence.
  \item 7 - Accurate assessment of performance well supported by evidence.
  \item 5 - Mainly accurate assessment of performance with some gaps in evidence.
  \item 3 - Assessment of performance not accurate and/or lacking in evidence.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Peer assessment (5 marks):}

\begin{itemize}
  \item 5 - Accurate assessment of performance well supported by evidence.
  \item 3 - Mainly accurate assessment of performance with some gaps in evidence.
  \item 1 - Assessment of performance not entirely accurate and/or lacking in evidence.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Lecturer assessment:} The lecturer's assessment is broken down into the following areas.

  \item 20 - Significant tasks are tracked with tickets which are promptly handled.  Useful comments or other documents are included in most tickets.
  \item 15 - Tasks are typically tracked by tickets, but some gaps are noted.  Minimal but sufficient documentation is included.  Most tickets handled promptly.
  \item 10 - Few tickets are found that were not submitted by the lecturer.  Documentation often lacking.  A significant number of tickets not handled promptly.
  \item 5 - No tickets are found that were not submitted by the lecturer.  Documentation generally insufficient.  Tickets are not generally handled promptly.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item 25 - Extremely comprehensive and accurate documentation of all hosts, software, and procedures.  Wiki history shows frequent updating throughout the term.
  \item 20 - Quality documentation of hosts, software and procedures.  Only trivial gaps or errors noted.   Regular updates in recent weeks.

Excellent use of teamwork is evidenced by ticketing, source code repository activity, wiki edits, etc.  The team has a schedule that provided good distribution of coverage.
  \item 7 -  Student does a fair share of work and all teammates are generally informed, but some small gaps may be noted.

\end{itemize}

You will submit your individual and peer assessment forms (see below) by %5:00 PM on 
Wednesday, 12th April (at the end of the lecture latest). Performance in teams can vary over time. In case your team has experience some sort of coordination or communication problems (e.g.~too many team members), what mechanisms did you put in place to address this? Did it work?

The lecturer assessment will take place in an individual appointment during weeks 10/11.  You should be prepared to present evidence of your work (e.g.~example ticket histories) during this appointment.
