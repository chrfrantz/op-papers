\section*{Introduction}
Last time we made a Puppet module for \texttt{sudo}.  That module wasn't very flexible, however.  It only worked because we configure \texttt{sudo} in the exact same way on every system. Today we'll make a more flexible module to manage our hosts files.  To accomplish this, we'll make use of Puppet's \emph{variables}, \emph{conditionals}, and \emph{templates}.

\section{Module setup}
Create a standard module structure in the \texttt{/etc/puppet/modules} directory of your puppetmaster.

\texttt{hosts\_file} \\
\texttt{hosts\_file/manifests} \\
\texttt{hosts\_file/files} \\
\texttt{hosts\_file/templates} \\

Create an \texttt{init.pp} file in your \texttt{manifests} subdirectory.

\section{Module manifest}
Put the following code in your \texttt{init.pp} file.  Adjust the IP addresses to match your systems.

\begin{verbatim}
  class hosts_file {
    if $osfamily == 'Debian' {
      include deb_hosts
    }
    elsif $osfamily == 'windows' {
      include win_hosts
    }
  }

  class hosts_file::deb_hosts {
    file { "/etc/hosts" :
      ensure => present,
      owner => 'root',
      group => 'root',
      mode => 0444,
      content => template('hosts_file/debhosts.erb'),
    }
  }

  class hosts_file::win_hosts {
    file {"C:/windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts" :
      ensure => present,
      content => template('hosts_file/winhosts.erb'),
    }
  }
  
\end{verbatim}

\newpage

There are a few new things happening in this manifest.
\begin{itemize}
  \item We're using a \emph{variable}, \texttt{\$osfamily}.  We can define and use our own variables, but many variables are populated for us by a utility called \emph{Facter}.  You can see a list of the core facts produced by Facter at \\ http://docs.puppetlabs.com/facter/1.6/core\_facts.html.
  \item We are using an \texttt{if/elsif} structure to conditionally select which Puppet class to use based in the operating system of the agent.
  \item Instead of copying over static files, we are using \emph{templates}.  The template files are to be placed in the \texttt{templates} subdirectory of the module.  Puppet's templates use the erb (Embedded Ruby) templating system.
\end{itemize}

\section{Template files}
Finally, we need to write our template files in the \texttt{templates} subdirectory of our module.  The text of those files is below.

\textbf{debhosts.erb}
\begin{verbatim}
127.0.0.1       localhost <%= hostname %>
10.26.1.50      ad ad.micro-agents.net
10.26.1.51      app app.micro-agents.net
10.26.1.52      db db.micro-agents.net
10.26.1.53      mgmt mgmt.micro-agents.net
10.26.1.54      backup backup.micro-agents.net

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
\end{verbatim}


\textbf{winhosts.erb}
\begin{verbatim}
127.0.0.1       localhost <%= hostname %>
10.26.1.50      ad ad.micro-agents.net
10.26.1.51      app app.micro-agents.net
10.26.1.52      db db.micro-agents.net
10.26.1.53      mgmt mgmt.micro-agents.net
10.26.1.54      backup backup.micro-agents.net

\end{verbatim}

In these templates we are inserting the correct value for the local host name with the \texttt{hostname} variable that is defined by Facter.
