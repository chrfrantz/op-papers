\frametitle{Modules}
  A collection of related resources can be organised into a \emph{module}.  For example, we may want to install the bacula-fd package, its configuration file, and set up a working directory for restores.  We can create a module that incorporates all of these things, and then use the module in a node:

\begin{verbatim}
node 'foo.example.org' {
  include bacula-client
}
\end{verbatim}

We will create and apply a module in today's second lab.
