I am a lecturer in the Bachelor of Information Technology (BIT) programme at 
Otago Polytechnic in Dunedin, New Zealand. This programme, and my own work 
within it, focuses on teaching students to be well prepared to enter the
IT profession. As such, it contains less theory and a bit more practical 
applications than a typical computer science programme does. In the BIT we 
strive to use current tools and to demonstrate current industry best practices.
In this setting it's natural to use Git and GitHub to manage and share teaching
materials.

These materials are also offered here to facilitate open collaboration with
others, although for at least the time being I'm making no effort to 
generalise them for use outside my own programme. I may do so in the future if
demand warrants it.
